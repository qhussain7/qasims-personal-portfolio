      <p>
        Build Your Own World is a 2D world generator created in Java, allowing users to dynamically generate
        environments with rooms, hallways, and interactive elements. This project showcases my ability to implement
        advanced object-oriented design principles and algorithmic problem-solving.
      </p>
      <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented Design</li>
        <li>Data Structures</li>
        <li>File I/O</li>
        <li>2D Rendering</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Project Outcome:</h2>
      <p>
        The final result was a fully interactive 2D world that provides an engaging and unpredictable experience. The
        ability to save and load game states added a layer of depth and replayability for users.
